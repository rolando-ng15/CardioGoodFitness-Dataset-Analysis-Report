```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
data <- read.csv("CardioGoodFitness-2.csv")
```



# 1. Load Dataset and Metadata

```{r}
head(data)
```

```{r}
str(data) #Shows the structure of the dataset, including each variable’s type and example values.

nrow(data) #Tells how many rows (customers) are in the dataset.

ncol(data) #Tells how many columns (variables) the dataset contains.

names(data) #Lists the names of all the variables in the dataset.

```



# 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
## Categorical Data
```{r}
table(data$Product) #Counts how many customers bought each treadmill model.
barplot(table(data$Product), main="Treadmill Models", col="yellow") #Show the number of customers for each treadmill model.


table(data$Gender) #Counts how many male and female customers there are.
barplot(table(data$Gender), main="Gender Count", col="pink") #Compare the number of male vs. female customers.


table(data$MaritalStatus) #Counts how many customers are single or partnered.
barplot(table(data$MaritalStatus), main="Marital Status", col="blue") #Show the number of customers in each marital status group.
```



## Numerical Data
```{r}
hist(data$Age, main="Age Distribution", xlab="Age") #Shows which age ranges are most common.

hist(data$Income, main="Income Distribution", xlab="Income") #Shows the spread of customer incomes and helps identify low, medium, and high earners.

hist(data$Education, main="Education", xlab="Years") #Displays how many years of education customers typically have.

hist(data$Usage, main="Weekly Usage", xlab="Times per Week") #Shows how often customers plan to use the treadmill each week.

hist(data$Miles, main="Miles per Week", xlab="Miles") #Displays how many miles customers expect to run per week.

```



# 3. Categorical vs Categorical

```{r}
barplot(table(data$Product, data$Gender), beside=TRUE, legend=TRUE, main="Product by Gender") #Compare how many males and females purchased each treadmill model.

barplot(table(data$Product, data$MaritalStatus), beside=TRUE, legend=TRUE, main="Product by Marital Status") #Show how single and partnered customers differ in the treadmill models they purchased.

```



# 4. Numerical vs Numerical
```{r}
plot(data$Usage, data$Miles, main="Miles vs Usage", xlab="Usage", ylab="Miles") #Show the relationship between weekly treadmill usage and the number of miles customers plan to run.

plot(data$Age, data$Income, main="Income vs Age", xlab="Age", ylab="Income") #Show how customer income varies across different ages.

```



# 5. Categorical vs Numerical

```{r}
boxplot(Income ~ Product, data=data, main="Income by Product", xlab="Product", ylab="Income") #Show how customer income levels differ across the three treadmill models.

boxplot(Fitness ~ Product, data=data, main="Fitness by Product", xlab="Product", ylab="Fitness") #Compare fitness ratings for customers who purchased each treadmill model.

boxplot(Usage ~ Gender, data=data, main="Usage by Gender", xlab="Gender", ylab="Usage") #Show how weekly treadmill usage differs between male and female customers.

```


# 6. Simple Linear Model
```{r}
model <- lm(Usage ~ Age + Income + Education, data=data) #Linear model that tries to predict weekly treadmill usage based on age, income, and education.

summary(model) #Displays the model’s results, including coefficient estimates, significance levels, and how well the model explains usage (R2).
```


## Residual Plot
```{r}
plot(model$residuals, main="Residual Plot", ylab="Residuals") #Show how far the model’s predictions are from the actual usage values.

abline(h=0, col="red") #Just add a line at zero to help see whether residuals are evenly spread above and below 0.
```
